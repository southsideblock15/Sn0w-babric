## Basic Info

Hello all I am skitty and I am releasing my 2b2t hacked client after 5 years. It is widely considered the best client for crystal pvp, and pretty much the most sought after client in all of hvh. 

Many many many original features have been crafted into this client over the years like holesnap timer, chorus manipulation, fast phasewalk tat goes down and up, predict surround etc. blah blah blah just a bunch of shit like that.
bunch of original bypasses. I also want to make a note to the community i was scammed while making bypasses for shoreline client which is why i leaked there source. I had a deal with linus where i would make bypasses for him like 2b2t grim crits, working doublemine bypass, etc in exchange for visuals. 99% of shorelines star bypasses are all made by me. 

I never recieved the shader loader I was promised, and never got paid when i was promised to be paid aswell. So I got someone to send it to me and leaked there src.

# Why I released this
I have quit anarchy almost entirely since 2022, rarely playing and getting on. I have been pestered and pretty much extorted by my users who are pulling me back to this game to update this client. I have been threatened over and over for the past year of having my client leaked if i dont update. I even opened up my client as a scam because they convinced me too to pay for one of my users FUCKING DRUGS. I was originally going to release it for real and have bon work on the loader, but I ended up just scamming. I have 0 motivation to work on this client. 


# True history
i remember seeing a old history post or something abt this client, so i will give u all the true history for u larpers. Sn0w was a kami skid i made for 8b8t, however i didnt know how to actually code. I would change the modules and name in jbytemod and pretend i made a new hack :sob:. One day i was scrolling in the old cool client collectorz server and found hephaestus buildable src or viknet src maybe i don't remember. But yeah i used it and shit updated itand yeah. I eventually got extremely good over time on cheating on servers like hypixel and even 2b2t cc etc where im extremely knowledgable on how anticheats work and how to exploit them. I have found many exploits in mc itself aswell. Eventually i made a deal with 0IMAX where i traded the chorus blink exploit which only sn0w had for phasewalk on cc, and we eeventually made a deal to give over kami5 entirely. Ever since then ive been working on the kami5 base and yeah. 

I quit in 2022, I have played since then, but rather to update the client rather then playing. I only played 2b and others to update to 1.21.1 and other stuff. I got so fed up of shoreline being a shit client that I decided to update this to 1.20 my own. I was testing it for my good friend bon55. blah blah blah bro.

I know Ive done bad things, but i always have had a good moral compass. I never fucked with little kids or anything, and always gave peoples accounts back when i felt bad. It was mainly the people that i surrounded myself with that didnt really have a moral compass at all. 

# Warning before using
This client is extremely old (5 years) and is a huge mess of things i have made throughout my teenage years. I was 13 when i begun working on this and i am 18 now. Alot of things are pasted, and I will make credits soon. This client is private and has alot of weird features and names that you might not understand. All users of this client have exclusively used it for 5 years and many things that might seem conventional for others are completely twisted in this client. A feature might not do what u expect it to do, or might not work the way you want it to, but i built it around the way me jqq and kelan played in crystal pvp so it might be good for some people, but for others it might not be so. It's kinda a client u have to get used to using. 

You WILL crash, and you will run into issues. I am the only dev working on a fully standalone cheat that is as good as future mio etc for years. My back FUCKING hurts. every other standalone cheat has SEVERAL developers and i have built this client with just a base from oimax that i pretty much rewrote entirely over the years. We might have used this client in ways that WE personally play the game, and might not have a bug fixed in our nuker for example that crashes ur game, or whatever. This isnt meant for you all to use, and is a main reason why i never sold it ever. It isnt a premium quality cheat, but it certainly is the best one. 

If you guys think its bad, then cope. Me jqq kelan jaydon and gunther have all been king on this cheat for years and years. We shit on phobos users who got kicked all day on cc on a fucking heph skid. Shit on everyone on strict and grim and made the best cheat for grim in under a month. I ported from 1.12.2 -> 1.21.1 in a month and became the only cheat with a working doublemine for over 2 months. I had full disablers for several servers such as 5b5t and 0b0t (https://medal.tv/games/minecraft/clips/4WmoCXTkboq2a?invite=cr-MSx4WW0sMTIzNDEzODc&v=15, https://medal.tv/games/minecraft/clips/4Wm9d3T45zkcE?invite=cr-MSxzb0EsMTIzNDEzODc&v=15 ) It was and will remain probably the best cheat for a while for hvh if you learn to use it correctly. I reccomend pasting it as soon as u can cuz theres many features but i will let u all discover by playing and having fun on the client.

# Where u will go
 im focusing on college where im studying digital forensics and my girlfriend whom i love very much. I also have a brand new pc and have been enjoying playing games I havent been able to play while ive been focused on anarchy.
